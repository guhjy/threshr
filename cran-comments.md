## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.  In this version I have 

* Provided a better description of the package in the Description: field of the DESCRIPTION file. [Thank you for spotting that I'd missed this.]

* Removed the \dontrun{} wrapping from all the examples, except the slowest one, which is wrapped in \donttest{}.
